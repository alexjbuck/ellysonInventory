# Weird Gotchas

## **Lists have two filters**

1. The first is visable in the list/gallery view. If you click a header you can filter on that column.
2. The second is only found when looking at the back end. You have to:
    1. Click on the view selection drop-down
    2. Select "Edit current view"
    3. The page that loads should have a heading of "Settings > Edit View"
    4. Scroll down to the "Filter" section, and modify/remove the filter as needed.

> This one was found by inadvertently toggling the second filter method. The list would only show a single entry, no matter what I did. I was only able to resolve this when I found this second filter method. I switched it back to "Show all items in this view."
