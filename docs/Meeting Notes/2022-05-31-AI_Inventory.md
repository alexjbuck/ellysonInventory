## Attendees

- Jesse Nerius
- Alex Buck
- Pete Wolt
- Kristy Sakano

## Objectives

- Does this (SharePoint) make sense?
- Does this meet the need?

Pete Wolt: Before we go ahead, we should get this in front of the rest of the COI Advisory Group. "I can't officially `task` the NAWC folks to do anything, because I'm NAVAIR".

Things to be careful of:

- We don't want to keep two sets of books. We should send them back to STAIRS (or the authoritative source).
- STAIRS ingests SBIR program management database (PMDB). PBDB is the authoritative source for STTR, SBIR.
- STAIRS is the authoritative source for NICE. Funding profile is loaded in STAIRS but maybe isn't fully updated.
- FNC (Future Naval Capabilities) - Tech program from ONR.

STAIRS doesn't hold all projects. So we need something in SharePoint for those that don't have another home (e.g. Harbinger+Air).

Kristy really liked the filtering that SharePoint lists can provide. It was a pretty intuitive interface. STAIRS can be pretty slow to use.

### Showing STAIRS

You can "Tag" a list of projects and then view that list again later. Then you can share the "tagged" list with others. Tags are like categories of saved entries. Tags don't seem useful.

to Jarvis - What time do you have available?

- I need to work out the update procedure.
- Who exports from STAIRS?

### Do we need other fields?

Kristi - Keywords would be really useful as an extra field.

## Tasks

- Ingest of new projects (Forms?)
- Ingesting a CSV from STAIRS was problematic (issues with quotes making it really hard to just _paste_ in. It was very manual.)
- How to merge two CSVs where one is a subset of the other?
- Edit button logic to post back to origin data source (if STAIRS, link to STAIRS via project ID)
    -  `https://stairs.navair.navy.mil/projectOverview.aspx?id=<ID>`
- Access to stairs (Pete Wolt said he'd work this.)

## Next Steps

- Present hybrid approach at next COI meeting, if able, otherwise Jesse will.
